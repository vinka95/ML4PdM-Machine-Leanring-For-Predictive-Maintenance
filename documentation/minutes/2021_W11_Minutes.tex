\section{Topics Discussed:}

\subsection{General Class Diagram}
\subsubsection{Details}
\begin{hiddensubitems}
    \item Selami presented once again the idea on the design of the general class diagram and pointed
    out the changes from last week.
    \item Paul explained the difference in transformer and fixed size feature type. Did we decide on the type of input for transformer types? We remove all extra classes.
    \item Evaluator methods renamed.'eval model or eval splitter' changed to 'dataset splitter'.
    \item Object variable and how it is used.
    \item Change data structure in make pipeline to be an array for the two configs.
    \item What is expected and predicted value. Have the same ordering for metrics, <ground truth, predicted> suggested ordering. Always have the same order.
\end{hiddensubitems}

\subsection{General Sequence Diagram}
\subsubsection{Details}
\begin{hiddensubitems}
    \item In the second loop, average over all the metrics.
    \item Currently it looks like only the last evaluation result is given.
    \item Collection of results needs to be specified.
    \item Move splitter left or right off evaluator. show that splitter is used by evaluator by having a small arrow. without much detail.
    \item We want to have parsers as static, shift the boxes together or use constructor to initiate parsers.
\end{hiddensubitems}
\subsubsection{Aditional Information}
\begin{hiddensubitems}
    \item People involved: Tanja Tornede and Team.
\end{hiddensubitems}

\subsection{TFE}
\subsubsection{Details}
\begin{hiddensubitems}
    \item TFE, class diagram, described by Sanjay.
    \item Often only univariate timeseries is considered, they usually assume different instances are of the same length, need to work on this more during implementation.
    \item Change structure of TFE class diagrams in draw.io file.
    \item Long arrows in the seq diagrams. Different styles in current seq diagrams, maintain consistency.
    \item Include user in the seq diagrams, to get more context, instead of arrows originating from nothing.
    \item Use constructors to represent a new class.
    \item pyts is mostly for univariate classes, might need uni to multi variate transformer.
    \item One for pyts, one for TSFresh, one for autoencoder and one for windowing. Exclude all other diagrams. Needed only for wrappers
    \item new construct arrows are missing for tensorflow and sklearn methods. Move blue boxes to bottom, as discussed already.
\end{hiddensubitems}
\subsubsection{Aditional Information}
\begin{hiddensubitems}
    \item People involved: Tanja Tornede and Team.
\end{hiddensubitems}

\subsection{HIE}
\subsubsection{Details}
\begin{hiddensubitems}
    \item Change the arrangement of class diagram boxes, free the overlapping arrows, have reasonable height and width.
    \item In LSTM Autoencoder box, multiple lstm units param used in the method train-encoder-decoder()
    \item In HGRUN, why need feature extractor in HGRUNN, if we already have the required features.
    \item Check how TS is used in StandardScaler.
    \item Selami, to list the steps for fitting and predicting in case of LSTMAutoencoder.
    \item Predict methods for all approaches to be worked upon.
    \item Add constructor classes.
\end{hiddensubitems}
\subsubsection{Aditional Information}
\begin{hiddensubitems}
    \item People involved: Tanja Tornede and Team.
\end{hiddensubitems}

\subsection{RUL}
\subsubsection{Details}
\begin{hiddensubitems}
    \item Fit and transform to be used on all blue boxes(tensorflow, sklearn stuff).
    \item Random forest class should be an ensemble. Add multi classifier approach as subclass.
    \item Direct RUL and CNN to have an abstract box, that would allow user to choose only SVR or CNN to that of the approach from seed papers.
\end{hiddensubitems}
