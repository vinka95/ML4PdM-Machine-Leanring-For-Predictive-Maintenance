    Each member presented their work.
\end{hiddensubitems}

\subsection{General notes for document review}
\subsubsection{Details}
\begin{hiddensubitems}
    \item Use "ht" in square brackets for figures and tables
    \item Check correct word spelling: time series, dataset, multivariate
    \item Always use "\textbackslash ref\{\}" for section/image/table references
    \item Use "\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}" for real value space. Add "\_\{\textbackslash geq 0\}" if you want to restrict it.
    \item Use "\textbackslash textwidth" for image width (with optional factor e.g. "0.8\textbackslash textwidth")
    \item Do not use height for images at the same time
    \item Use "Figure \textbackslash ref\{\}", "Table \textbackslash ref\{\}" and "Equation \textbackslash ref\{\}"
    \item Every figure should be mentioned and explained in the text (but not in brackets)
    \item Don't have "paper squares" in background of figures
    \item Mention that images are taken from paper and not just add reference
    \item Use bold table headings and add all table lines
    \item Check for overflow warnings due to math notations
    \item Embed references in the text and not just add them at the end of the paragraph (very important!)
    \item Look for LaTeX warnings and errors in your chapter
