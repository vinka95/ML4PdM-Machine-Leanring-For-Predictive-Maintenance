# Meeting minutes
## When you write minutes:
1. Copy the `minutes-template.tex` from the folder `template`.
2. Rename the file according to this format: `[year]_W[calenderweek-number]_Minutes.tex`. Examples: `2020_W45_Minutes.tex` or `2021_W01_Minutes.tex` (**Note:** write single digit week-numbers with a leading `0` for sorting purposes)
3. Upload/push the `.tex` **and** the compiled `.pdf` file in this folder.

## Note:
Don't edit or re-upload any `.tex` or `.pdf` files that you haven't created unless discussed in the group.
