# Weekly reports
## ToDo (when your weekly status report does not yet exist):
1. Copy the weeky status report `.tex` file from the folder `template`.
2. Rename the file according to this format: "Weekly_Report_[your full name].tex". Example: `Weekly_Report_Christopher_Zinda.tex` (**Note:** seperate the proper nouns of your name with underscores: "firstname_lastname").
3. Upload/push the `.tex` **and** the compiled `.pdf` file in this folder.

## Note:
Don't edit or re-upload any `.tex` or `.pdf` files that doesn't include your name!
