The current trend of digitization has opened up a whole new dimension to maintenance and its services. Especially with the emergence of Industry 4.0 and machine learning within artificial intelligence, predictive maintenance(PdM) is seen as one of the key elements and is
extensively applied across industries for handling their equipment health status. Recent advancements in information processing techniques, networking infrastructure and computation ability, has made it possible to collect and process massive amounts of data generated by a number of sensors for an industrial equipment. Machine learning (ML) techniques are applied on such data in the process of fault detection and diagnosis with the purpose of increasing the utilization rate and minimizing the downtime of equipments. PdM is inevitable for sustainable smart manufacturing in Industry 4.0. This report aims to provide a comprehensive review of the machine learning approaches used for tackling 4 challenging topics in predictive maintenance: time series feature extraction (TFE), health state classification (HSC), health index estimation (HIE) and remaining useful lifetime (RUL) estimation. Along with different datasets used, this report also describes performance metrics to compare and understand state-of-the-art ML approaches for each of the challenging topics.
